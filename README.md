### Just for fun, some analytic tools and templates for looking at ACLED files. 

In this example, I've looked specifically at ways of characterizing US-based racial justice protests as of October 2020. Some of the following methods were used:
* Attributes already encoded in ACLED data
* Some light scripting to dig deeper in the data, including text fields, and infer some additional data points. 
* Results are combined across multiple variables to characterize these recorded events along a time series
* Some high-level inferences and statistical observations are noted 
A lot more could be done with this, to include correlations with external data sets. 

*Note: this is not meant to be a partisan endeavor, simply an exercise in letting data speak for itself.*
